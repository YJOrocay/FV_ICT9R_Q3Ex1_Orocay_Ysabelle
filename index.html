				 The famous cartoon show the "Loud House" made my childhood a joyful memory. Here are some of my favorite characters, one of which is Lola Loud. <br> <br> 
				 <font color="#d62770"> <li> Lola is the third youngest of the Loud siblings. She is also Lana's twin sister. </li> 
				 <br>
				 <li> Lola is a sharp-tongued beauty queen. She carries a great sense of self-importance, and is always ready to be on the offense if someone crosses her. She can be quite materialistic and will go to great lengths to get what she wants.</li></font>

				 <br>
				 <li> Though the second-youngest of the Louds, Lisa is a child prodigy, so she's the smartest kid in the bunch. Because of this, she often tends to be egocentric, boorish, condescending, and sarcastic with other people. She speaks with a lateral lisp, and usually has a stoic frown, though she does smile from time to time.</li></font>
